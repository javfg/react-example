# What does it show

This app shows a basic web UI to help you decide where to travel based on the weather in a location.

* It uses openweathermap API to fetch weather info.
* Very basic usage of web storage for persistence.
* Usage of async/await syntax.

# Get it running
1. Replace `<YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_APIKEY_HERE>` with a working api key in the file `secrets.js`.

2. ```npm i; npm start```

# What is missing?

* [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are not used in the demo and would be interesting to showcase. Would be a good exercise to convert some components to use them.
* [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) would be nice to have too.
